# TASK 1: launch two AWS EC2 instances using aws management console :- 
AMI: Redhat9 
Instance_type: t3.micro


# TASK 2: Enable a password less authentication between the both the machines :-
==> Condition first : if you already have key pair on both machine
 -> On first instance, generate an ssh key pair through ssh-keygen command. 
 -> And copy the content of id_rsa.pub key. 
 -> Now login to second machine through ssh username@machineIP 
 -> And paste the content in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
 -> Ensure correct permission :
       chmod 700 ~/.ssh
       chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
 -> Now try ssh from first machine to second machine again :
       ssh <username>@<second_machine_ip>

==> Conditon second : If you don't have SSH key pair
 -> On first instance, generate an ssh key pair through ssh-keygen command.
 -> Copy the public key to the second instance:
       ssh-copy-id <username>@<second_machine_ip>
 -> Test SSH login without password:
       ssh <username>@<second_machine_ip>

# TASK 3: Create a directory on the first machine and set up automatic transfer :-
1) Create a directory /var/remote on the first machine:
    mkdir /var/remote
2) Create a script for syncing files and directories using "rsync". 
   vim file_sync.sh
   

# TASK 4: Schedule the script to run automatically at every 10 minutes using cron job
  1) Edit crontab : crontab -e 
  2) add this line : */10 * * * *  /usr/local/bin/file_sync.sh
